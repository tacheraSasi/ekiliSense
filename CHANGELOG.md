## Migration Guide

### From v1.0 to v2.0

#### Database Migration

```bash
# 1. Backup your database
mysqldump -u user -p database > backup_v1.sql

# 2. Run new migrations
mysql -u user -p database < database/migrations/001_subscription_system.sql
mysql -u user -p database < database/migrations/002_security_improvements.sql

# 3. Test the system
# 4. Monitor error logs for issues
```

#### Code Updates

1. **Replace config.php includes**:
   ```php
   // Old
   include_once "../config.php";
   
   // New
   require_once "../includes/init.php";
   ```

2. **Update password verification**:
   ```php
   // Old (will still work but deprecated)
   if (md5($password) === $stored_hash) {
       // login
   }
   
   // New (recommended)
   if (Security::verifyPassword($password, $stored_hash)) {
       // login
   }
   ```

3. **Add CSRF protection to forms**:
   ```php
   <?php $csrfToken = Security::generateCSRFToken(); ?>
   <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="<?php echo $csrfToken; ?>">
   ```

4. **Update database queries**:
   ```php
   // Old (vulnerable to SQL injection)
   $result = mysqli_query($conn, "SELECT * FROM schools WHERE email = '$email'");
   
   // New (secure)
   $result = $db->selectOne("SELECT * FROM schools WHERE School_email = ?", [$email], 's');
   ```

#### Configuration Updates

1. Create `.env` file from `.env.example`
2. Update database credentials
3. Configure security settings
4. Set up payment gateway credentials
5. Configure email/SMS services

### Breaking Changes

- Password hashes are automatically upgraded on first login
- Direct mysqli queries should be replaced with Database helper
- All forms require CSRF tokens
- Session configuration has changed (more secure defaults)

### Backward Compatibility

Version 2.0 maintains backward compatibility with:
- Existing database structure
- User authentication (with automatic upgrade)
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Role-based permissions
