                Welcome to <span class="highlight">ekiliSense</span>, proudly
                owned by <span class="highlight">ekilie</span>. We are dedicated
                to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring the integrity of your

            <h2>1. Data Protection and Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                Your data is important to us. We promise to protect your
                personal information and maintain its integrity.
                <span class="highlight">ekiliSense</span> only collects data
                that is necessary to enhance your experience on our platform. We
                will never share or sell your data without your explicit
                consent.
            </p>

            <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
            <p>
                When creating an account, you agree to provide accurate and
                up-to-date information. You are responsible for securing your
                login credentials, and any actions under your account are your
                responsibility.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Subscription & Payment</h2>

                Our Premium plan is billed starting at

                you authorize us to charge your chosen payment method. You may

                industry-standard security measures to protect your data. While
                we make every effort to secure our systems, we cannot guarantee
